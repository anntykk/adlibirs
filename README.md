# Random book generator

## About this project
This is a side-project I came up with in order to learn more about python, web scraping, building data pipelines, modelling data and interacting with a database.
The main purpose is create a random book generator in order to select the next book for my book club. In order to get there the project creates a web scraper to collect data on books from the website 
adlibris.se. It then cleans and models the data and inserts it to a MySQL database. From the database it then selects a random book, based on specified filter(s). 

## Caveats
This is meant to be a learning project and should not be seen as a final product. At this point it achieves the main purpose but there are improvements to the code that could be done in order to make it cleaner (for example reducing repetitions) and run more efficiently.
